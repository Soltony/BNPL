# LoanFlow - Advanced Micro-Credit Platform

LoanFlow is a comprehensive, multi-provider micro-credit platform built with a modern technology stack. It provides a robust solution for managing the entire loan lifecycle, from initial provider configuration and dynamic credit scoring to borrower application, automated processing, and final repayment. The platform features distinct interfaces for administrators and borrowers, a maker-checker approval workflow for critical changes, and a sophisticated Loan Cycle feature to manage credit progression.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Admin & Borrower Interfaces**: A secure, feature-rich admin dashboard for management and a separate, simplified flow for borrowers to apply for loans.
*   **Multi-Provider & Product Management**: Administrators can create and configure multiple loan providers (e.g., different banks) and define various loan products with unique rules, fees, and interest rates.
*   **Dynamic Credit Scoring Engine**: Each provider can build their own weighted credit scoring model using a powerful rules engine. This allows them to weigh different data points (like income or employment status) to automatically determine a borrower's eligibility and maximum loan amount.
*   **Loan Cycle Progression**: A sophisticated, grade-based feature that manages a borrower's access to their full credit limit. The system encourages good repayment behavior by gradually increasing a borrower's trust and access to capital based on their performance across multiple loans. Administrators can configure the progression metric (e.g., total loans taken, on-time repayments) and the payout percentages for each cycle.
*   **End-to-End Loan Lifecycle**: Borrowers can check eligibility, apply for a loan, and receive funds. The system tracks the entire lifecycle, including disbursement, daily fee accrual, penalties, repayments, and overdue statuses.
*   **Maker-Checker (Approval) Workflow**: Critical administrative actions, such as changing product rules, provider settings, or tax configurations, are submitted for approval by a designated "Approver" role, ensuring data integrity and operational control.
*   **Automated Backend Processes**: The application includes scheduled background services for processing automated loan repayments from borrower accounts and for identifying and flagging Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) based on configurable rules.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting & Auditing**: Admins have access to a detailed, exportable reporting suite to monitor key metrics like portfolio health, collections, income, and fund utilization. All critical actions are logged for compliance and security.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The platform features a granular access control system, allowing administrators to define roles and permissions for different user types, restricting access to sensitive data and features.
